=============================
I implement StorageUnite as a parent class for locker and 
LTS because they had much functions in common,
At the locker and LTS tests I reset the lockers capacity
by the before command.
At Booping site I used Manali as the city for my tests.

Tried to seperate as much as I could my test,
so that each test will check every function the class have.
